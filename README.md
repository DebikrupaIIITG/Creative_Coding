# Creative_Coding
This repository holds up all my new code works that I have learnt recently. Javascript is used in this whole repository.  
Without using any other programming language, this whole thing is built using a javascript tool named "Canvas".
This "Canvas" tool is quite a powerful tool which can bring out your imaginationd to a plot of canvas using the Javascript code formats.

I will upload my works soon as I complete some of the pending works.
I will also give you basic informations and how to work with canvas, and help you bring out your imaginations into the canvas.
Hope all of you will support me, learn and experience something new while we are working on this.
